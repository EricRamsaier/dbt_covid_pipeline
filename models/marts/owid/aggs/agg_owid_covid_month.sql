-- Model:         agg_owid_covid_month
-- Purpose:       Aggregates COVID metrics by continent and observation date
-- Notes:
--   - Source is fct_owid_covid, which is contract-enforced and complete
--   - Aggregates key metrics like cases, deaths, and tests at the continent/month grain
--   - Excludes rows where continent is NULL

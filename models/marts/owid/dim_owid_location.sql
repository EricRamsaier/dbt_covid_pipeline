-- Model:         {{ this.identifier }}
-- Purpose:       Extracts unique OWID locations including countries, regions, and aggregates (e.g. "World", "EU")
-- Notes:
--   - Assigns surrogate key (sk_location) to each distinct `location`
--   - Used for joins to fact tables without repeating text labels
--   - Locations may not always map to real countries â€” validate downstream interpretation
